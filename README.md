# NorthernCrown.HttpClient
These are a simple set of classes that sit on top of the standard .NET System.Net.Http.HttpClient class. I find myself writing the same/similar code for client projects several times per year, so I finally decided to add some actual class design and abstraction so I have some reusable components.

This library is far from feature complete and may or may not be particularly useful to anybody else.
